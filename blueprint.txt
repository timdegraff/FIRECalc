PROJECT OVERVIEW: FIRECALC RETIREMENT PLANNER
================================================================================
FIRECalc is a high-fidelity financial architecture tool designed for precision 
planning, specifically optimized for the 2026 Michigan tax/benefit landscape. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CORE PHILOSOPHY & UI PREFERENCES
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.  AESTHETICS: High-contrast "Dark Mode" (Slate-900/800/950). 
    - NUMBERS: Must use 'Inter' with tabular-nums or 'JetBrains Mono'.
    - LABELS: 'Inter' font with heavy weight (800+) and tracking-tighter.
2.  COLOR LOGIC (STRICT ADHERENCE):
    - Teal (#14b8a6): Growth, Assets, Net Worth, HSA.
    - Pink (#ec4899): Expenses, Liabilities, Debts.
    - Magenta/Pink-400 (#f472b6): Cash.
    - Emerald/Green-500 (#10b981): Brokerage / Taxable Assets.
    - Blue (#3b82f6): Pre-Tax / 401k / Strategy.
    - Purple (#a855f7): Post-Tax / Roth.
    - Amber/Orange (#f59e0b): Crypto (Bitcoin).
    - Yellow (#eab308): Metals (Gold).
    - Indigo (#6366f1): Real Estate.
    - Rose (#fb7185): 529 Plan.

BURNDOWN ENGINE & DECUMULATION LOGIC
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.  DYNAMIC HOUSEHOLD SIZE: The engine checks the simulation year against 
    "Dependent Independence Dates." Household size (hhSize) decreases over time, 
    lowering the FPL (Federal Poverty Level) floors annually.
2.  STRATEGY PERSONAS:
    - MAX_SUBSIDY: Pulls to hit 138% FPL (Medicaid/SNAP max).
    - SUBSIDIZED_BRIDGE: Pulls to hit 250% FPL (Silver CSR sweet spot).
    - UNCONSTRAINED: No strategic harvesting; pulls for budget only.
3.  SURPLUS RECYCLING: Strategic "over-pulls" are automatically applied to 
    HELOC debt, then recycled into the liquid Cash bucket.
