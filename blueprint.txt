PROJECT OVERVIEW: FIRECALC RETIREMENT PLANNER
================================================================================
FIRECalc is a high-fidelity financial architecture tool designed for precision 
planning, specifically optimized for the 2026 Michigan tax/benefit landscape. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CORE PHILOSOPHY & UI PREFERENCES
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.  HOUSEHOLD SYNC: Total Family Size (hhSize) is a derived value:
    Base (1) + Spouse (1 if MFJ) + Dependents.
    Users should not add themselves or their spouse as dependents.
2.  COLOR LOGIC (STRICT ADHERENCE):
    - Teal (#14b8a6): Assets, Net Worth.
    - Pink (#ec4899): Expenses, Debts.
    - Blue (#3b82f6): Pre-Tax / Strategy.
    - Purple (#a855f7): Roth.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
BURNDOWN ENGINE & DECUMULATION LOGIC
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.  DEPENDENT INDEPENDENCE: The engine recalculates hhSize every year of the 
    simulation. When a dependent hits their "Independence Year," hhSize drops, 
    lowering the FPL (Federal Poverty Level) floors.
2.  STRATEGY PASSES:
    - PASS 1: Survival (Meet Budget).
    - PASS 2: Strategy (Harvest up to Persona Limit: 138% or 250% FPL).
    - PASS 3: Tax Spiral (Withdraw extra to cover the taxes generated by Pass 1 & 2).
