TO DO LIST & ARCHITECTURAL ROADMAP
================================================================================
[HUMAN-ONLY ACCESS: AI AGENTS ARE PROHIBITED FROM MODIFYING OR EDITING THIS BOX]
[THE FOLLOWING SECTION IS RESERVED FOR THE HUMAN ARCHITECT]

CRITICAL FUTURE UPDATES:
- [ ] Phase 1: REFACTOR - Migrate "Hybrid Architecture" to 100% React. Eliminate Vanilla templates.js.
- [ ] Phase 1: INTEGRITY - Move logic to TypeScript (FireEngine.ts) to prevent currency-to-string math errors.
- [ ] Phase 1: STATE - Replace window.currentData with React Context/Zustand for true reactivity (no more forceSync).
- [ ] Phase 2: PERFORMANCE - Offload Burndown simulation (70+ year loops) to a Web Worker.
- [ ] Phase 2: REVENUE - Add "Educational Needs" section in Budget for automated 529 drawdown tracking.
- [ ] Phase 3: INTELLIGENCE - Use Gemini Grounding to fetch live 2026+ IRS limits (401k/HSA) automatically.

V3.5 COMPLETED TASKS:
- [x] Implementation: "Strategy Personas" (Platinum Hunter vs Silver CSR).
- [x] Optimization: "Cash Ceiling" in Burndown to prevent over-selling.
- [x] UX: Redesigned Benefits module with editable Child/Baby icons & Independence Years.
- [x] UX: Contextualized "Earned vs Unearned" toggles within Sandbox MAGI.
- [x] Documentation: "Dependent Recalculation" logic added to Engine Doc.

PROJECT OVERVIEW: FIRECALC RETIREMENT PLANNER
================================================================================
FIRECalc is a high-fidelity financial architecture tool designed for precision 
planning, specifically optimized for the 2026 Michigan tax/benefit landscape. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CORE PHILOSOPHY & UI PREFERENCES
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.  HOUSEHOLD SYNC: Total Family Size (hhSize) is a derived value:
    Base (1) + Spouse (1 if MFJ) + Dependents.
2.  COLOR LOGIC (STRICT ADHERENCE):
    - Teal (#14b8a6): Assets, Net Worth.
    - Pink (#ec4899): Expenses, Debts.
    - Blue (#3b82f6): Pre-Tax / Strategy / Jobs.
    - Purple (#a855f7): Roth.
3.  REPLICATIVE DATA: The system currently "scrapes" the DOM. Future versions 
    must move to a "Reactive Model" where the UI reflects the state object.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
BURNDOWN ENGINE & DECUMULATION LOGIC
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.  DEPENDENT INDEPENDENCE: The engine recalculates hhSize every year of the 
    simulation. When a dependent hits their "Independence Year," hhSize drops, 
    lowering the FPL (Federal Poverty Level) floors.
2.  STRATEGY PASSES:
    - PASS 1: Survival (Meet Budget).
    - PASS 2: Strategy (Harvest up to Persona Limit: 138% or 200% FPL).
    - PASS 3: Tax Spiral (Withdraw extra to cover the taxes generated).
